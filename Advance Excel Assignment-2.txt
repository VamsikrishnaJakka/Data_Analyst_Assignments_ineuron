1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
Ans: It indicates the absolute cell reference in formulaes. It cannot be changed

2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
Ans: For example, 
                  =SUM(A2,B2) -> Here A2 is relative cell reference
                  =SUM($A2,B2) -> Here $A2 is absolute cell reference
    So with a dollar sign, we can change a cell reference from relative to absolute.

3. Explain the order of operations in excel?

4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax
for any of two?
Ans: Sum, Average, Count, Minimum, Maximum

Syntax of Sum:      =SUM(number1,[number2],....)
Syntax of Average:  =AVERAGE(number1,[number2],....)


5. When would you use the subtotal function?
Ans:Sometimes, we recive the raw data which is not in the order. Lets say we hae a different garments shop data of diff color dresses with different sizes and different rates.
So we sort the data as per color(lets say). Then we count the total of how may black color(here) shirts are there in each shop. And then total black in all shope. Then total garments in all shops
need data based on different categories. So, SUBTOTALS help us to get the totals of several columns of data broken down into various categories.In such cases we use it.


6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
Ans:   Syntax:
             =VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
->lookup_value - The value to look for in the first column of a table.
->table_array - From which data retrieved. It can be a column or it can be a table too.
->col_index_num - It is the column number of the table from which the matching value returned.
->range_lookup - TRUE for approximate match (default)
                 FALSE for exact match
